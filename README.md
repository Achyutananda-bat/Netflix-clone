ðŸ“º Netflix Clone (UI Only) â€“ Beginner Web Development Project
This is a Netflix Clone UI built using HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a frontend-only project created as part of my learning journey into web development. The goal of this project was to replicate the look and feel of Netflixâ€™s homepage â€” including layout, fonts, images, and basic responsiveness.

ðŸ”§ Current Features:

Netflix-style homepage layout

Header with logo, nav, and call-to-action

Background image with dark gradient tint

Sections for featured content

ðŸš€ Plans for Future:
As I continue learning, I plan to make this site interactive using JavaScript â€” adding things like:

Login/Signup form functionality

Carousel sliders

Responsive mobile nav

Dynamic content loading

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
This project is my starting point in web development and helps me practice:

HTML structure and semantics

CSS styling and layout (Flexbox, Grid)

Responsive design principles
